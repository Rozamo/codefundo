The focus of our app is to help those who are currently in the areas affected by floods, earthquakes, landslides and other natural disasters. We are making a multipurpose app which will help the users in many situations.


Our app will feature an Emergency Location Mode in which the current location of the user is broadcasted to selected contacts if he is in need of help  via text message. 
The user can manually add and remove contacts that would to be notified according to his/her interest.

Most important part of disaster management lies in alerting or warning the inhabitants of the area or region that is likely to be in danger zone. Thus, we have included a ALERT_MESSAGE to alert the users about any possible changes or information about the prediction. Alert message would be send through Azure. We have used NotificationsHub for the same.

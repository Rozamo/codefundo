The focus of our app is to help those who are currently in the areas affected by floods, earthquakes, landslides and other natural disasters. We are making a multipurpose app which will help the users in many situations.

Prediction:
We would use weather data available on the Indian Meteorological Department's website to monitor and predict the natural disasters present on the region. The app would take in the user's location and coupled with the nearby region's data the app would alert the user if the nearby locations are safe or not. 

Prevention:
Our app will feature an Emergency Location Mode in which the location of the user is broadcasted to his contacts if he is in need of help. Moreover the app will also feature the SOS signal for communication in drastic circumstances.

The focus of our app is to help those who are currently in the areas affected by floods, earthquakes, landslides and other natural disasters. We are making a multipurpose app which will help the users in many situations.

Our app will feature an Emergency Location Mode in which the location of the user is broadcasted to his contacts if he is in need of help. Moreover the app will also feature the SOS signal for communication in drastic circumstances.
